### Responsive_Portfolio

This is unit 2's homework. My goal was to begin the process of designing my portfolio! Below is the minimum requirements needed to complete the assignment. 
Note: I struggled with the Bootstrap grid system, therefore I was not able to make my portfolio fully responsive. Each Navbar does contain links, however they currently do not work. 
I enjoyed this homework and discovered exactly where I need to grow as a developer. Enjoy!


### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
